# Visualization

I am still not a fan of using QGIS for producing my maps, but the animations from the time manager are pretty cool!

# Reproducibility

Sentinel-2 imagery is available for free. You can donload them from [ESA SciHub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) or [CREODIAS finder](https://finder.creodias.eu/).
As a reference data I use freely available Forest Data Bank available [here](https://www.bdl.lasy.gov.pl/portal/udostepnianie-en).
In this database, there are basic units called _subareas_, and for each subarea, the share of particular species is known. 

I performed processing in R software using packages: **raster**, **RStoolbox** and **caTools**
The most important functions were:

* [`stack()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.0-7/topics/stack) for reading satellite imagery

* [`shapefile()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.0-7/topics/shapefile) for reading shp containing reference areas

* [`sample.split()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caTools/versions/1.17.1/topics/sample.split) for dividing reference polygons into training and validation data

* [`superClass()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/RStoolbox/versions/0.2.6/topics/superClass) for super-vised image classification. 

The results of this study were published in Remote Sensing, you can find the article [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/10/1197/htm).

I really need to make a repository with my scripts, because there are too many of them.

# Science communication

## Key remarks from my study are:

My audience is generally divided into two groups: remote sensing specialists and foresters (forest scientists?). The audience thus determines how I prepare presentations or papers.
